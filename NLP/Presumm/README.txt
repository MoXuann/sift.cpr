This is text summarizer NLP model, folked from NLPyang - https://github.com/nlpyang/PreSumm

The outcome is great. I have deleted the models used in this project. Download it @ author's github

The challenges faced:
- for json file:
	-need to add tgt(target), the example summary that you want model to interfere
	
- installing ROUGE:
	-pip install pyrouge
	-need to install ROUGE in order to use the model. For more setup, see this link: https://medium.com/@prabha88978/installation-working-process-of-rouge-1-5-5-6c0dfdca49e8

Files usage:
- data preprocesing.ipynb
	-convert .txt to .json
