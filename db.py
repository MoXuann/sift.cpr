However, answer to queries could have been accurate & not confusing if HP representative knows their product better and will be very helpful for future upgrades. Actually, the maintenance and service guide for this product can be searched in Google using \"14-cm0xxx maintenance and service guide\".",

            "review": "I was due for a new computer, replacing a refurbished one I bought in 2013. This laptop is a really impressive piece of machinery - it's sleek and light. It is in Windows \"S\" mode - but it is not any type of difficult to convert. I was literally prompted at some point to exit S mode and I was off to the races. As far as web browsing, downloading and running apps, etc. (i.e. everyday use things) it's a real pleasure to use. I hook this up to a larger, stand alone monitor, a set of speakers, and bluetooth keyboard and mouse when I get home, with a port left to charge my phone. The software is real and valid - to the point where I found myself inundated with advertisements and prompts from both Microsoft and HP. Still, it only took a couple hours to set it up to my preferences and bring my files back over from a USB. The one thing I find troublesome is actually the track pad, which I supplement with the touchscreen. 5 stars for ~$300 - not bad!",

I wasn't looking for the best but I found it at best buy on a labor day sale and got it down to $285 after tax with my student discount they offer on this model. Somehow its running Inventor smooth enough to get me through the assignments of my entry engineering courses. Also nice feel on keys, screw the resolution everything looks great. If you want a better computer spend that cash. If you want something you can load up with word files, do research on, and do the basics this thing is awesome! I don't think giving it 2 stars represents this product at all.",

I bought two from bestbuy @ $249 each and have no complaints except that it does not have a fingerprint reader. Great laptop for basic needs, just not over $300. Also, keep in mind that HP might not honor the warranty unless purchased from an authorized dealer ( ie: bestbuy ).",
