# A very nice laptop and it feels premium. The material is mostly plastic but I appreciate that for the reduced weight. This is my first Ryzen machine, and I am mainly using it to run a Citrix environment (cloud-based VM). Today will be the first full 8+-hour day using it. The power brick is not excessively huge. About the width and height of a standard post-it note, and 1" thick. The cable is over 5' (my measuring tape only goes to 60") closer to 6'. It has a barrel connector so unfortunately, it is not easily replaceable with a USB C cable (next model, pretty please?)
#
# The keyboard is backlit, which is nice for the darker surrounding often found in my home office. Typing is okay, but there is a noticeably shorter key travel than other laptops/Chromebooks I have used. I'm getting used to it, but like with any new keyboard, there will be a small learning curve. I keep missing the home row and using the Caps Lock as the A key for some reason. I'm using it on a small folding table at the moment so that could be the reason.
#
# The screen is nice, it is a 16:9 full HD screen, and for me, I prefer 16:9 to the new standard of 2:3 (more of a square). It is not bright though. Not at all. Even with the curtains open, there are times when I am still trying to get more brightness out of this display. It's not unusable, but forget trying to use it outdoors.
#
# Touch is fine and works. I did not buy this to use as a tablet though but Windows 10 has some processing going on in the background that makes it easy to hit small buttons in applications without being terribly accurate. The pen is interesting to me as it is roughly the size of a real pen [cough Samsung*cough*] which makes it easier to draw/write with without immediately cramping my hand.
#
# The Dolby Audio on the speakers leaves a lot to be desired. Some tweaking was needed to get the overblown sounds to subside. During the initial setup, it was hard to listen to. Turning Dolby Audio off though somehow reduces the speaker volume by 2/3... Not the actual volume percentage, but the actual sound. Dolby is using some sort of gain control so 20% volume sounds more like 40%.
#
# 4k video on YouTube looks great and only dropped 3 frames in a 2:44 video (Borderlands 3 FLAK FTW!) but that could have been from me trying to make it full-screen. I have not tried any games yet, but I did install Diablo 3, and World of Warcraft Classic. If anyone is interested, I will update this when I try them.
#
# With the Vega graphics, there is an automatic 2GB reduction in RAM availability. Couple this with the 8GB model and you are left with 6GB to run Windows 10 and any applications. Budget for the 12 GB model unless you are A) skilled with laptop hardware, and B) don't care about the warranty. I've seen the tear-downs, and there is an open RAM slot. I usually don't tear open electronics until a year after I own it (unless there is a reason to do so).
#
# The WiFi issue that is detailed on the 8GB model is non-existent for me. I feel like I may be more qualified to test that as Citrix requires a constant network connection and gives an immediate alert if connectivity drops for more than a couple seconds. No issues here, running the latest Windows updates.
#
# Overall I'm happy with this laptop, It is much lighter than my 15‚Äù Acer Predator and looks a lot more professional when traveling for work.

Apple had a winner with the iPhone XR, and while its follow up doesn\u2019t have to rewrite the book on mobile phones, it needs to do enough to be a worthy heir to the throne. The new iPhone 11 is up to the task, with compelling changes to the camera that will have even users of the year-old iPhone XR... The iPhone 11 offers solid camera performance and power to spare for a relatively reasonable price. It isn't exciting, but it's a good replacement for older iPhones. Apple may have skipped flashy extras on this year's phones, but the iPhone 11 is the best midtier model the company's ever made. Apple has repeated its approach from 2018 for the September iPhone refresh, and just like last year there are three models. Apple's iPhone 11 has much of what makes the iPhone 11 Pro great for less than what the iPhone XR cost, and is very clearly the device that Apple wants people to buy. A week after using the iPhone 11, I've concluded it is my ideal phone. It's affordable in today's market, where $1,000 phones reign supreme. It's a perfect size. It's fast. It has an ultra-wide-angle camera and another camera that can capture stunning photos at night. Apple iPhone 11 review: At Rs 64,900 in India, the iPhone 11 is way cheaper than what iPhone XR was when it launched. Here is our review of the new iPhone 11 and how it performs, especially in the camera department. The Apple Event 2019 brought three new iPhones and a new naming scheme. As before, there is a more affordable iPhone, the main flagship and a larger Max variant. But what distinguishes the individual models, exactly? Let's take a closer look. The iPhone 11 is cheaper, but not cheap. It costs as much as many of the current Android flagships. But in the Appleverse, it is the one you get if you are on the budget. And the maker made sure you will want to get it. Today, the Apple iPhone 11 series are now available in Malaysia and it's that time of the year again on which telco plan is the best one for you. Well, we have round up the four telcos - Celcom , Digi , Maxis and U Mobile so without further ado, check out what they have to offer below! Apple's cheap iPhone is even cheaper than ever, and it comes with most of the iPhone 11 Pro's coolest features. So, what are the tradeoffs? This is the iPhone for the average Apple smartphone user The iPhone 11 gets you every important iPhone 11 Pro feature, like an ultra wide camera, for hundreds less. The iPhone 11 costs Rs 64,900 (64GB), Rs 69,900 (128GB) and Rs 79,900 (256GB), along with offers on Amazon and Flipkart bringing down prices further. If I can move from Apple\u2019s most powerful 2018 handset to the iPhone 11 and be happy, I believe anyone will be thrilled at upgrading from an iPhone 7, 7 Plus, or anything older. This is one of the simplest reviews I\u2019ve ever had to write: the iPhone 11 is the phone most people who are upgrading to a new iPhone this year should get. It\u2019s an excellent phone, with one of the best cameras I\u2019ve ever seen on a smartphone and terrific battery life. Apple iPhone 11 is the latest smartphone from Apple launched in September 2019. The device is the direct successor of last year\u2019s iPhone XS , and come with updates specifications and features in almost similar body aesthetics with the iPhone XR . It's so close in capabilities to the iPhone 11 Pro that only display, camera, and radio nerds may really notice any day-to-day differences. And, for exactly those nerds, I'll also be posting a much deeper, more detailed review of the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max , so be sure to check that... The iPhone 11 strikes a brilliant balance between features and price. You wouldn't know it's the cheaper of Apple's 2019 phones from its build, camera and speed. If only it had an OLED screen\u2026
